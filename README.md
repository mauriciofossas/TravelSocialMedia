City and flight finder and sharer. Users can register and login; upon succesful registration and login users have access to a central "feed" where they are able to see flights other users have found or are still looking for. <br>
Users have access to an individual search engine to look for cities, and can filter by continent, country, minimum population, and maximum population, and are shown a random city that satisfies their filters. They can then look up flights to the airport closest to that city given they provide an airport to fly out of (which is validated through our database) and a departure date. Users are then forwarded to studentuniverse.com to look at their flight and upon returning to the page have the oportunity to share their findings on the central feed.
